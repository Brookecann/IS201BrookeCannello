                        <p>After graduating from Sand Creek High School on the honor roll, Brooke Cannello applied to further her education at a local college know by Pikes Peak Community College. She was unaware of what she wanted to study, but was certain that she needed to learn more so that she can one day be a helpful contribution to her community.</p>
                        <p>The various classes she took there prepared her for university level learning in her future. Brooke Cannello took classes such an microeconomics, macroeconomics, college calculus, accounting, and english just to name a few. All the classes helped guide her to make a choice. For example, it was in her english classes at the college, that she discovered she would never want to write another paper ever again. </p>
                        <p>In the begining of her continuing education, her aspiration was to become a lawyer. However, after a political science course she took at the college she pursued something of more interest to her. One year into her efforts to find her passion she signed up for an accounting class.</p>
                        <p>This was a pivital point in her education and it lit her passion for finance and accounting. From there she took her knowledge and ran with it.</p>

                        <p> After applying to Brigham Youg University, Brooke Cannello had no idea she would actually be admitted into the university. To her surprise she recieved an acceptance letter to her email a few months later. She was excited to find a school that would enhance and help her learn more.</p>
                        <p>It was at Brigham Young University that she really grew the most. The courses were expotientially harder than high school and even the collge courses she was used to. She is eternally grateful to her peers and professors that helped encourage her to continue in her education despite the stretches in learning and growth that seemed almost unbareable.</p>
                        <p>She finished her general education classes at BYU taking courses like Physical Science and Philosophy while completing the prerequists for Finance and Accounting.</p>

                        <p>Classes at Pikes Peak Community College were so helpful for Brooke Cannello's learning. While she did learn lots from her classes, at PCCC, she learned more about what she wanted to do in her future, than about an actual course.</p>
                        <p>One class in particular, her macroeconomics class, helped her discover she could merge her educational goals with her humanitarian goals. There was a project where students were asked to study a nonprofit organization and critique the business and find ways to make it more efficient. After this class Brooke Cannello was able to find that her desires to help people and her business-minded approach to life could coexist.
